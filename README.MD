This repository contains the code for my MSc Thesis, "Performance Evaluation of GPS Autosurveying Techniques". This is the final version that was used, and, while it works, it is not "clean" code and some things aren't well documented. I apologize for any inconvenience. The data used for the thesis can be accessed in the following repository: https://github.com/JGManito/msc-thesis-data

Future support for this code should not be expected, since any future work on my part based on this code will involve a major code rewrite to improve usability.

This code was designed with ease of reading and understanding in mind, **not** performance. I tried to make every routine obvious in how it works, but that also lowered the performance signifficantly (especially in the RINEX parser routine).

If you're reading this, the thesis report hasn't been officially published. Should you wish for a copy, feel free to send me a message and I'll forward a copy.
